Connect 4 (5-in-a-Row) Game

### Description 
5-in-a-Row, a variation of the famous Connect Four game, is a two-player connection game
in which the players first choose a color and then take turns dropping colored discs from the
top into a nine-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down,
occupying the next available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the
first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of five of one's own discs.
